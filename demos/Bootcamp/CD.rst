**Bootcamp Material**
=====================

Much of the demo material is part of the bootcamp installation. You
could go about installing the whole package as follows::
   
  curl -O https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/edu/data/CD.tgz
  tar xvzf CD.tgz
  cd CD
  tcsh s2.cp.files . ~
  cd ..

which will unpack the Bootcamp demo data into your home directory.
