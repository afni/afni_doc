Overview
========

Below are links to other useful lectures and lecture series that we
consider potentially quite useful for understanding MRI, data analysis
or both.  Some have been made by AFNI group members, but many are by
other groups and kindly provided for public dissemination.

FMRIF Summer Course
===================

The Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging Core Facility (FMRIF) is a
core within the National Institute of Mental Health of the NIH that is
big into brain imaging.  In recent years they have organized and
hosted a series of educational lectures during the summer involving a
wide array of topics, including MRI and brain imaging (amongst many
other interesting topics).  The latest set of their lectures are
available here (see panel at the left, for several years' worth of
recorded talks): `FMRIF Summer Course Homepage
<https://fmrif.nimh.nih.gov/index.php/SummerCourse>`_.

Thanks to Peter Bandettini and Dorian Van Tassell for
organizing that and making the lectures available.
