Download AFNI handouts
=========================

A lot of material about using the AFNI software toolbox are kept
locked in the secret afni_handouts vaults.  Now, for the first time in
history, they are also available from this webpage!  

To obtain the directory, you can do any of the following:

* Click this download link: `(current) AFNI handouts directory <https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/edu/data/CD/afni_handouts.tgz>`_

* Copy+paste to a terminal::
    
    curl -O https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/edu/data/CD/afni_handouts.tgz

* Copy+paste to a terminal::
    
    wget https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/pub/dist/edu/data/CD/afni_handouts.tgz

To open the directory, you can then copy+paste this to a terminal::

  tar -xvf afni_handouts.tgz

\.\.\. which should produce a directory called "afni_handouts/" in
that location.

.. note:: If you are preparing to attend an AFNI Bootcamp, know that
          this afni_handouts directory is also part of the Bootcamp
          data download.  You can download the whole Bootcamp data
          directory from :ref:`here <install_bootcamp>`, or you can do
          it as part of setting up AFNI on your computer, following
          instructions for your particular operating system
          :ref:`listed here <install_page>`).
