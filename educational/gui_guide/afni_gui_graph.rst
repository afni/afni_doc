Open Some Graph Windows
=======================

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 0
   
   * - * ``Graph`` buttons for the adjacent views (Axial, Sagittal,
         Coronal)

         * Normal: button opens a viewing window
         * Inverted: button raises opened window
         * Right-click on an inverted button 'fetches' the graph
           window
       
       * ``Graph`` buttons are *usually* only meaningfull if the
         selected underlay dataset has a time index (*usually* some
         functional image)
              
       * ``Graph`` buttons are only enabled for datasets that are
         viewing their data files directly

         * Not warping on demand -- see the top of the ``Define
           Datamode`` control panel :ref:`(see here)<Define Datamode>`

Graph Window
============

.. list-table::
   :widths: 60 40
   :header-rows: 0
   
   * - * Graph viewer takes voxel values from same dataset as image
         viewer
   
         * If dataset has only 1 sub-brick, graph viewer only shows
           numbers (Not very useful unless you are an MRI physics
           type, perhaps)
 
       * To look at images from one dataset locked to graphs from
         another dataset, must use 2 AFNI controllers and ``Define
         Datamode`` â‡’ ``Lock`` on AFNI control panel

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 0
   
   * - * If graph and image viewer in same slice orientation are both open, 
         crosshairs in image window change to show a box containing dataset 
         voxels being graphed

.. list-table::
   :widths: 50 50
   :header-rows: 0

   * - * Central sub-graph (current focus location) is outlined in
         *yellow*
         
         * Current time index is marked with small red diamond on data
           graph
         * Left-clicking in a non-central sub-graph moves that
           location to focus. Making it the *yellow* center sub-graph
           and moving the crosshairs on the image window to match the
           new location.
         * Left-clicking in central sub-graph moves time index to
           nearest point
         
           * Can also use ``Index`` control in AFNI controller to
             change time
           
         * Right-clicking in any sub-graph pops up some statistics of
           its data
