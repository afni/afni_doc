``imcat`` is an "image concatenation" program.  This is a *very* useful
supplementary tool for glueing existing images together to make arrays
with separating lines, as well other features.  Combines quite
usefully with ``@chauffeur_afni``, for example to concatenate similar
images across a data set.
