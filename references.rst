..  A slightly odd way of formatting the bibliography part of this, I
    know... But this balances a few things, importantly: 1) clearly
    delineating each reference, and 2) starting each of the
    refereneces at the same distance from the left margin.

    The reference label is defined by choosing the first letter of
    each author's surname, followed by the underscore, and then the
    year.  For works with more than 6 authors, I would recommend
    something like 'X_etal_2015' (and such consideration has led to
    the horizontal starting point of the second column; also, if there
    is more than one paper by the same group or group name, one can
    add a single letter to the year, e.g., 'X_etal_2015a',
    'X_etal_2015b', etc.).

    Please add papers alphabetically by the first author's surname.

    The vertical lines make each facet of the citation start on a new
    line (just looked nice visually).

    Eventually, we can put links directly to the papers here!
