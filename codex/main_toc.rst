AFNI Codex: Code Examples from publications
============================================

Below is an archive of "larger" AFNI commands that have been used in
published work.  We thank the authors who have kindly agreed to put
their AFNI processing commands and/or scripts onto the interweb for
public reference and use.  These take the guess work out of
translating a paper's Methods section into a command and provide a
good starting point for building your *own* scripts with AFNI.

Scripts and commands may be provided in simplified/basic form. One can
also expect that file names or any other identifying information has
been removed, relabelled, recoded, etc.  We will try to make such
instances obvious.

As the field develops, preferred processing steps will surely change
over time.  We will try to note these cases and their rationales when
possible, but please reach out to discuss any possible improvements or
modernizations.

We are always (well, *usually*) happy to answer questions via the AFNI
`Message Board <https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/community/board/>`_,
and hopefully these scripts further the discussion.
