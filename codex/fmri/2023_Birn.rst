Introduction
============

Here we present commands used in the following paper:

    resting-state functional MRI. Front Neuroimaging 2:1072927.

**Abstract:**  
The monitoring and assessment of data quality is an essential step in
the acquisition and analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) data. Ideally
data quality monitoring is performed while the data are being acquired
and the subject is still in the MRI scanner so that any errors can be
caught early and addressed. It is also important to perform data
quality assessments at multiple points in the processing
pipeline. This is particularly true when analyzing datasets with large
numbers of subjects, coming from multiple investigators and/or
institutions. These quality control procedures should monitor not only
the quality of the original and processed data, but also the accuracy
and consistency of acquisition parameters. Between-site differences in
acquisition parameters can guide the choice of certain processing
steps (e.g., resampling from oblique orientations, spatial
smoothing). Various quality control metrics can determine what
subjects to exclude from the group analyses, and can also guide
additional processing steps that may be necessary. This paper
describes a combination of qualitative and quantitative assessments to
determine the quality of fMRI data. Processing is performed using the
AFNI data analysis package. Qualitative assessments include visual
inspection of the structural T1-weighted and fMRI echo-planar images,
functional connectivity maps, functional connectivity strength, and
temporal signal-to-noise maps concatenated from all subjects into a
movie format. Quantitative metrics include the acquisition parameters,
statistics about the level of subject motion, temporal signal-to-noise
ratio, smoothness of the data, and the average functional connectivity
strength. These measures are evaluated at different steps in the
processing pipeline to catch gross abnormalities in the data, and to
determine deviations in acquisition parameters, the alignment to
template space, the level of head motion, and other sources of
noise. We also evaluate the effect of different quantitative QC
cutoffs, specifically the motion censoring threshold, and the impact
of bandpass filtering. These qualitative and quantitative metrics can
then provide information about what subjects to exclude and what
subjects to examine more closely in the analysis of large datasets.
