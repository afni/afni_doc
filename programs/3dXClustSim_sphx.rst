    This program takes as input random field simulations
    (e.g., from 3dttest++) and does the ETAC processing to
    find cluster figure of merit (FOM) thresholds that are
    equitable (AKA balanced) across
      * voxel-wise p-values (-pthr option)
      * blurring cases      (-ncase option)
      * H power values      (-hpow option) -- probably not useful
    as well as being balanced across space to produce
    a False Positive Rate (FPR) that is approximately the
    same for each location and for each sub-case listed
    above. The usual goal is a global FPR of 5%.
    
    * This program can be slow and consume a LOT of memory!
      (And I mean a BIG LOT, not a small lot.)
    
    * The output is a set of multi-threshold (*.mthresh.*.nii)
      files -- one for each of the -ncase inputs.
    
    * These files can be used via program 3dMultiThresh
      to produce an 'activation' mask.
    
    * 3dXClustSim is intended to be used from 3dttest++
      (via its '-ETAC' option) or some other script.
    
    * It is not intended to be run directly by any but the most
      knowledgeable and astute users. Which is why this help is so terse.
