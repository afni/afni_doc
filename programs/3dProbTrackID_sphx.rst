      FACTID-based tractography code, from Taylor, Cho, Lin and Biswal (2012),
      part of FATCAT (Taylor & Saad, 2013) in AFNI.
      
      Estimate locations of WM associated with GM ROIs, particularly between
      pairs of GM in a network;  can process several networks in a given run.
    
      !!All usage has been migrated to 3dTrackID (with modes to select for
        deterministic, mini-probabilistic and full probabilistic tracking).
    
      So get thee hence;  see '3dTrackid -help' for all options, and consider
        downloading and installing the latest version of the FATCAT demo set
        for lots of examples, scripts and descriptions: @Install_FATCAT_DEMO.
