      Use jackknifing to estimate uncertainty of DTI parameters which are
        important for probabilistic tractography on per voxel basis.
    
      Produces useful input for 3dTrackID, which does both mini- and full
        probabilistic tractography for GM ROIs in networks, part of 
        FATCAT (Taylor & Saad, 2013) in AFNI.
    
      This version has been reprogrammed to include parallelized running via
      OpenMP (as of Oct, 2016).  So, it has the potential to run a lot more 
      quickly, assuming you have an OpenMPable setup for AFNI. The types/formats
       of inputs and outputs have not changed from before.

      + OUTPUT:
         1) AFNI-format file with 6 subbricks, containing uncertainty
            information. The bricks are in the following order:
                [0] bias of e1 in direction of e2
                [1] stdev of e1 in direction of e2
                [2] bias of e1 in direction of e3
                [3] stdev of e1 in direction of e3
                [4] bias of FA 
                [5] stdev of FA

      + RUNNING, need to provide:
        -inset  FILE     :file with b0 and DWI subbricks 
                          (e.g., input to 3dDWtoDTI)
        -prefix PREFIX   :output file name part.
        -input  INPREF   :basename of DTI volumes output by,
                          e.g., 3dDWItoDT or TORTOISE. Assumes format of name
                          is, e.g.:  INPREF_FA+orig.HEAD or INPREF_FA.nii.gz .
                          Files needed with same prefix are:
                          *FA*, *L1*, *V1*, *V2*, *V3* .
        -input_list FILE :an alternative way to specify DTI input files, where
                          FILE is a NIML-formatted text file that lists the
                          explicit/specific files for DTI input.  This option is
                          used in place of '-input INPREF'.
                          See below for a 'INPUT LIST FILE EXAMPLE'.
    
        -grads  FF       :file with 3 columns for x-, y-, and z-comps
                          of DW-gradients (which have unit magnitude).
                          NB: this option also assumes that only 1st DWI
                          subbrick has a b=0 image (i.e., all averaging of
                          multiple b=0 images has been done already); if such
                          is not the case, then you should convert your grads to
                          the bmatrix format and use `-bmatrix_FULL'.
      OR
        -bmatrix_Z  FF   :using this means that file with gradient info
                          is in b-matrix format, with 6 columns representing:
                          b_xx b_yy b_zz b_xy b_xz b_yz.
                          NB: here, bvalue per image is the trace of the bmatr,
                          bval = b_xx+b_yy+b_zz, such as 1000 s/mm^2. This
                          option might be used, for example, if multiple 
                          b-values were used to measure DWI data; this is an
                          AFNI-style bmatrix that needs to be input.
        -bmatrix_FULL FF :exact same as '-bmatrix_Z FF' above (i.e. there are N
                          rows to the text file and N volumes in the matched
                          data set) with just a lot more commonsensical name.
                          Definitely would be preferred way to go, for ease of
                          usage!
    
        -iters  NUMBER   :number of jackknife resample iterations,
                          e.g. 50.
        -mask   MASK     :can include a mask within which to calculate uncert.
                          Otherwise, data should be masked already.
        -calc_thr_FA  FF :set a threshold for the minimum FA value above which
                          one calculates uncertainty; useful if one doesn't want
                          to waste time calculating uncertainty in very low-FA
                          voxels that are likely GM/CSF.  For example, in adult
                          subjects one might set FF=0.1 or 0.15, depending on
                          SNR and user's whims (default: FF=-1, i.e., do all).
        -csf_fa NUMBER   :number marking FA value of `bad' voxels, such as 
                          those with S0 value <=mean(S_i), which breaks DT
                          assumptions due to, e.g., bulk/flow motion.
                          Default value of this matches 3dDWItoDT value of
                          csf_fa=0.012345678.

    + DTI LIST FILE EXAMPLE:
         Consider, for example, if you hadn't used the '-sep_dsets' option when
         outputting all the tensor information from 3dDWItoDT.  Then one could
         specify the DTI inputs for this program with a file called, e.g., 
         FILE_DTI_IN.niml.opts (the name *must* end with '.niml.opts'):
           <DTIFILE_opts    
             dti_V1="SINGLEDT+orig[9..11]"
             dti_V2="SINGLEDT+orig[12..14]"
             dti_V3="SINGLEDT+orig[15..17]"
             dti_FA="SINGLEDT+orig[18]"
             dti_L1="SINGLEDT+orig[6]" />
         This represents the *minimum* set of input files needed when running
         3dDWUncert. (Note that MD isn't needed here.)  You can also recycle a
         NIMLly formatted file from '3dTrackID -dti_list'-- the extra inputs
         needed for the latter are a superset of those needed here, and won't
         affect anything detrimentally (I hope).
