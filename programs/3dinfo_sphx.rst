    Prints out sort-of-useful information from a 3D dataset's header
    Usage: 3dinfo [-verb OR -short] dataset [dataset ...]
      -verb means to print out lots of stuff
      -VERB means even more stuff
      -short means to print out less stuff [now the default]
      -h: Mini help, at time, same as -help in many cases.
      -help: The entire help output
      -HELP: Extreme help, same as -help in majority of cases.
      -h_view: Open help in text editor. AFNI will try to find a GUI editor
      -hview : on your machine. You can control which it should use by
               setting environment variable AFNI_GUI_EDITOR.
      -h_web: Open help in web browser. AFNI will try to find a browser.
      -hweb : on your machine. You can control which it should use by
              setting environment variable AFNI_GUI_EDITOR. 
      -h_find WORD: Look for lines in this programs's -help output that match
                    (approximately) WORD.
      -h_raw: Help string unedited
      -h_spx: Help string in sphinx loveliness, but do not try to autoformat
      -h_aspx: Help string in sphinx with autoformatting of options, etc.
      -all_opts: Try to identify all options for the program from the
                 output of its -help option. Some options might be missed
                 and others misidentified. Use this output for hints only.
      
    Alternative Usage (without either of the above options):
      3dinfo -label2index label dataset
      * Prints to stdout the index corresponding to the sub-brick with
        the name label, or a blank line if label not found.
      * If this option is used, then the ONLY output is this sub-brick index.
        This is intended to be used in a script, as in this tcsh fragment:
          set face = `3dinfo -label2index Face#0 AA_Decon+orig`
          set hous = `3dinfo -label2index House#0 AA_Decon+orig`
          3dcalc -a AA_Decon+orig"[$face]" -b AA_Decon+orig"[$hous]" ...
      * Added per the request and efforts of Colm Connolly.

      3dinfo <OPTION> [OPTION ..] dataset [dataset ...]

                     in each field (column)
       -hdr: Same as -header_line

                             Default ATR_DELIM is the tab character.
    
      === Options requiring dataset pairing at input ===
        3dinfo allows you to make some comparisons between dataset pairs.
        The comparison is always done in both directions whether or not
        the answer can be different. For example:
              3dinfo -same_grid dset1 dset2 
        will output two values, one comparing dset1 to dset2 and the second
        comparing dset2 to dset1. With -same_grid, the answers will always
        be identical, but this might be different for other queries.
        This behaviour allows you to mix options requiring dataset pairs
        with those that do not. For example:
              3dinfo -header_line -prefix -n4 -same_grid \
                                  DSET1+orig DSET2.nii DSET3.nii DSET4.nii
    
       -same_grid: Output 1 if the grid is identical between two dsets
                          0 otherwise. 
                   For -same_grid to be 1, all of -same_dim, -same_delta,
                   -same_orient, -same_center, and -same_obl must return 1
       -same_dim: 1 if dimensions are the same between dset pairs
       -same_delta: 1 if voxels sizes are the same between dset pairs
       -same_orient: 1 if orientation is the same between dset pairs
       -same_center: 1 if geometric center is the same between dset pairs
       -same_obl: 1 if obliquity is the same between dset pairs
       -same_all_grid: Equivalent to listing all of -same_dim -same_delta
                       -same_orient, -same_center, and -same_obl on the 
                       command line.
       -val_diff: Output the sum of absolute differences of all voxels in the
                  dataset pair.
       -sval_diff: Same as -val_diff, but the sum is divided (scaled) by the 
                   total number of voxels that are not zero in at least one
                   of the two datasets.
    
       -monog_pairs: Instead of pairing each dset with the first, pair each
                    couple separately. This requires you to have an even
                    number of dsets on the command line
    
     Examples with csh syntax using datasets in your afni binaries directory
    
      0- First get some datasets with which we'll play
         set dsets = ( `apsearch -list_all_afni_P_dsets` )
    
      1- The classic
         3dinfo $dsets[1]
    
      2- Produce a table of results using 1-value-options for two datasets
         3dinfo  -echo_edu -prefix_noext -prefix -space -ni -nj -nk -nt  \
                   $dsets[1-2]
    
      3- Use some of the options that operate on pairs, mix with other options
         3dinfo -echo_edu -header_line -prefix -n4 -same_grid $dsets[1-4]
