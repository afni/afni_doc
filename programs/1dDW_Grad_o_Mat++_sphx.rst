      Simple function to manipulate DW gradient vector files, b-value
      files, and b- or g-matrices. Let: g_i be one of Ng spatial gradients
      in three dimensions; |g_i| = 1, and the g-matrix is G_{ij} = g_i * g_j
      (i.e., dyad of gradients, without b-value included); and the DW-scaled
      b-matrix is B_{ij} = b * g_i * g_j.
    
      **This new version of the function** will replace the original/older 
      version (1dDW_Grad_o_Mat).  The new has similar functionality, but
      improved defaults:
         + it does not average b=0 volumes together by default;
         + it does not remove top b=0 line from top by default;
         + output has same scaling as input by default (i.e., by bval or not);
           and a switch is used to turn *off* scaling, for unit magn output
           (which is cleverly concealed under the name '-unit_mag_out').
    
      Wherefore, you ask?  Well, times change, and people change.
      The above functionality is still available, but each just requires
      selection with command line switches.

    As of right now, one can input:
      + 3 rows of gradients (as output from dcm2nii, for example);
      + 3 columns of gradients;
      + 6 columns of g- or b-matrices, in `diagonal-first' (-> matA) order:
             Bxx, Byy, Bzz, Bxy, Bxz, Byz,
        which is used in 3dDWItoDT, for example;
      + 6 columns of g- or b-matrices, in `row-first' (-> matT) order:
             Bxx, 2*Bxy, 2*Bxz, Byy, 2*Byz, Bzz, 
        which is output by TORTOISE, for example;
    
      + when specifying input file, one can use the brackets '{ }'
        in order to specify a subset of rows to keep (NB: probably
        can't use this grad-filter when reading in row-data right
        now).
    During processing, one can:
      + flip the sign of any of the x-, y- or z-components, which
        may be necessary to do to make the scanned data and tracking
        work happily together;
      + filter out all `zero' rows of recorded reference images, 
        THOUGH this is not really recommended.
      
    One can then output:
      + 3 columns of gradients;
      + 6 columns of g- or b-matrices, in 'diagonal-first' order;
      + 6 columns of g- or b-matrices, in 'row-first' order;
      + as well as including a column of b-values (such as used in, e.g.,
        DSI-Studio);
      + as well as explicitly include a row of zeros at the top;

        -in_bvals  BVAL_FILE  :BVAL_FILE is a file of b-values, either a single
                               row (such as the 'bval' file generated by
                               dcm2nii) or a single column of numbers.  Must
                               have the same number of entries as the number
                                of grad vectors or matrices.
        -out_col_bval         :switch to put a column of the bvalues as the
                               first column in the output data.
        -out_row_bval_sep BB  :output a file BB of bvalues in a single row.
        -out_col_bval_sep BB  :output a file BB of bvalues in a single column.
    
        -unit_mag_out         :switch so that each vector/matrix from the INFILE
                               is scaled to either unit or zero magnitude.
                               (Supplementary input bvalues would be ignored
                               in the output matrix/vector, but not in the
                               output bvalues themselves.)  The default
                               behavior of the function is to leave the output
                               scaled however it is input (while also applying
                               any input BVAL_FILE). 
    
        -flip_x               :change sign of first column of gradients (or of
                               the x-component parts of the matrix)
        -flip_y               :change sign of second column of gradients (or of
                               the y-component parts of the matrix)
        -flip_z               :change sign of third column of gradients (or of
                               the z-component parts of the matrix)
        -no_flip              :don't change any gradient/matrix signs.  This
                               is an extraneous switch, as the default is to
                               not flip any signs (this is mainly used for
                               some scripting convenience
    
        -check_abs_min VVV    :By default, this program checks input matrix formats
                               for consistency (having positive semidefinite diagonal
                               matrix elements).  It will fail if those don't occur.
                               However, sometimes there is just a tiny values <0,
                               like a rounding error; you can specify to push through
                               for negative diagonal elements with magnitude <VVV,
                               with those values getting replaced by zero.  Be
                               judicious with this power! (E.g., maybe VVV ~ 0.0001
                               might be OK... but if you get looots of negatives, then
                               you really, really need to check your data for badness.
    
           (and the follow options are probably mainly extraneous, nowadays)
        -bref_mean_top        :when averaging the reference X 'b0' values (the
                               default behavior), have the mean of the X 
                               values be represented in the top row; default 
                               behavior is to have nothing representing the b0
                               information in the top row (for historical
                               functionality reasons).  NB: if your reference
                               'b0' actually has b>0, you might not want to 
                               average the b0 refs together, because their
                               images could have differing contrast if the
                               same reference vector wasn't used for each.
        -put_zeros_top        :whatever the output format is, add a row at the
                               top with all zeros.
        -bmax_ref THRESH      :THRESH is a scalar number below which b-values
                               (in BVAL_IN) are considered `zero' or reference.
                               Sometimes, for the reference images, the scanner
                               has a value like b=5 s/mm^2, instead of strictly
                               b=0 strictly. One can still flag such values as
                               being associated with a reference image and
                               trim it out, using, for the example case here, 
                               '-bmax_ref 5.1'.
