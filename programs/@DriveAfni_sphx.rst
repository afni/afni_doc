    @DriveAfni  - a demo program for driving 'afni' from a script
    
    The purpose is for one to review this script while executing it.
    
    This program requres the AFNI_data6 class data directory and must
    be run just above it (i.e. typing 'ls' should include AFNI_data6
    in the output).
    
         one output file is created: ./SavedAxiale.jpg
