     This program is for aligning a T1w anatomical to a T2w anatomical
     using solid body parameters (i.e., only translation and rotation);
     this program does not clean or alter the T1w's brightness values
     (beyond minor smoothing from regridding).  If one is going to be
     entering the T1w volume into the realms of FreeSurfer (FS), one might
     want to do this just *before* that step.  If one wants axialized (or
     AC-PC-ized) anatomical volumes, one could perform that step on the
     T2w volume *before* using this function.
    
     This program mainly assumes that the T1w and T2w volume come from the
     same subject, and have similar contrasts expected for standard
     sequences and healthy adult brains.  This might still work for other
     applications, but caveat emptor (even more than usual!).  This would
     *not* be recommended for aligning brains that aren't from the same
     subject.
    
     As part of this alignment, the T1w volume will end up with the same
     orientation and a similar FOV as the T2w volume.  Additionally, by
     default, the anatomical will be prepped a bit with an eye toward
     using FS, to have properties favorable to using it: 
    
       + the T1w volume is resampled to isotropic spatial resolution of
         either 1 mm voxel edges or, if the input volume has any edge
         length smaller than this, to that value (i.e., resampled to 1 mm
         or the minimum input voxel edge length, whichever is less).  The
         user can adjust this with the '-newgrid ...' option, or decide to 
         match the grid of the T2w volume via '-out_t2w_grid'. 
    
       + the T1w will have a FOV matching or quite similar to the T2w
         volume (as well as matching orientation).
    
       + the output T1w will be checked to ensure having an even number of
         rows along each axis; this is because FS somehow seems to want
         this for best behavioring. A slice of zeros will be appended in
         any direction with with an odd number of slices; turned off
         by using '-no_fs_prep'.
    
     Note that, if you are preparing to use FS afterwards, then make sure
     to use their current help files, archives, etc. for all options and
     settings.  For example, while at present (March, 2017) FS does seem
     to prefer isotropic voxels with 1 mm edge length by default, one can
     use high resolution options for data acquired at higher resolution.
     Anyways, you can read more about that there.
