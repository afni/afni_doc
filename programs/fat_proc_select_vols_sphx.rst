     This program is for building a selector string for AFNI subbricks
     and/or 1D text files.  It makes use of J. Rajendra's
     '@djunct_dwi_selector.sh' script to make a list of 'bad' volume
     indices by clicking on individual volumes in a montage image.  Pretty
     cool.
    
     In the end, a selector string of volumes *to keep* (i.e., the
     complement of the set of indices chosen with clicks) is output to
     screen as well as stored in a text file.

      OUTPUT:
    
        + PPP_bads.txt: text file with AFNI-usable selector string, which
                        can be put into either square brackets [] or curly
                        brackets {}, whichever is appropriate for a given
                        application.

      where:
    
       -in_dwi  DDD   :input DWI set (required).
       -in_img  IM2D  :2d image of DDD, such as made by a fat_proc* 
                       script, or @djunct_*imager directly (required).
       -in_bads TTT   :(optional) a single column file of integers,
                       such as made by a previous run of fat_proc_select_vols.
                       For example, if one has dual phase-encoded
                       DWI data, then one might make a list of bads
                       from the AP-acquired set and then add to it any
                       bad indices from the PA-acquired set.
    
       -prefix  PPP   :output prefix for files. Required.
    
       -apply_to_vols :switch to apply the created selection of good 
                       volumes to the DWI dset.  NB: if you are using 
                       this function to select out bad volumes from 
                       a dual phase encode set, then you *wouldn't* want 
                       to use this option, because you want to apply
                       the complete removal to *both* volumes.  Note also,
                       that once you apply this selection to the volumes,
                       you also need to apply it to any bval, bvec, bmatrix,
                       etc. text files!
    
        -do_movie AGIF | MPEG:
                       when "-apply_to_vols" is used, static images are 
                       output by default;  one can use this option with 
                       either of the given arguments to output a movie of the
                       newly created dset.  Only those arguments can be used
                       at present.
    
       -workdir WWW   :specify a working directory, which can be removed;
                       (default name = '__WORKING_select_vols').

                       and the location where it was run (otherwise, it is
                       saved by default in the ODIR/).
