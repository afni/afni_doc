Overview
========

The direct links for downloading precompiled binaries, as well as the
compilable source code, are provided here. AFNI now utilizes a version
numbering system, which is useful for tracking changes, getting help
on the `Message Board
<https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/afni/community/board/>`_, reporting in
published work, etc.  The three numbers roughly 


**"major.minor.micro"** (or roughly, *"yearly.quarterly.oftenly"*) updates.
