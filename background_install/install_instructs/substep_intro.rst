Each step involves either:
 A. copying+pasting commands (from the green fields) into the
    terminal, or
 #. clicking on a link to download+install a package.

We assume the user has admin privileges (can run ``sudo ...``), and
some steps require an internet connection. Some steps depend on the OS
version.

To find out what shell you are using (e.g., ``bash`` or ``tcsh``),
type::

  echo $0

**IMPORTANT:** Please:
 i. Do all steps.
 #. Run ``afni_system_check.py -check_all`` in the "Evaluate" stage.
 #. *And* follow the system check recommendations in the output
    "Please Fix" section.
