.. warning::  DEAR AFNI GURUS: some questions for the instruction pages:

   **!! do we mention what can go wrong?** 

   **Do we want to keep doing R this this way (home library), or use
    sudo to put in the the standard /usr/ path?**

   **For Ubuntu, what about setting the r-cran repo in the sources
    list?  I think that might be necessary still**

   **For Fedora, it is really necessary to do this package, even
     though we say that users should mostly use OpenMP64 elsewhere? 
    ``tcsh @update.afni.binaries -package linux_fedora_21_64``

     We should be consistent in what we say**

   **Should we mention things for ~/.bashrc?  I would think so...**
