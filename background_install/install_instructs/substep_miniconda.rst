#. AFNI has *very* minimal Python requirements---at present,
   matplotlib and numpy---and even these are used in only a couple
   places (though, for the :ref:`recommended automatic QC output from
   afni_proc.py <tut_apqc_help>`, matplotlib is necessary).

   While we don't require any specific method of installing Python and
   its dependencies, we have found `Miniconda
   <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ to be convenient
   in creating+managing Python environment(s), and replicatable across
   platforms.  **If** you are interested, you can check out :ref:`this
   tutorial <install_miniconda>`, which has both :ref:`verbose
   <install_miniconda_verbose>` and :ref:`quick
   <install_miniconda_quick>` instructions.

   But use any method you choose for meeting your Python needs.
