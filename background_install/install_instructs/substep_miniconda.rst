#. AFNI has *very* minimal Python requirements---at present,
   matplotlib and numpy. For example, for the :ref:`recommended
   automatic QC output from afni_proc.py <tut_apqc_help>`, matplotlib
   is necessary.

   You can use any method to install+manage Python and its
   dependencies.  But we note that we have found `Miniconda
   <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html>`_ to be convenient
   in managing Python environment(s), and it is replicatable across
   platforms.  **If** you are interested, you can check out :ref:`this
   tutorial <install_miniconda>`, which has both :ref:`verbose
   <install_miniconda_verbose>` and :ref:`quick
   <install_miniconda_quick>` instructions.

   But Miniconda is *not* required.
