Copy and Paste with Terminals
******************

It is often useful to copy+paste within and into terminals, for
example when following the AFNI install instructions.  This helps
avoid many mistakes that can occur with typing (tyypos, mistaking "O"
and "0", etc.).  

On many operating systems and in many applications, copying is done by
highlighting text and typing "Ctrl+c", and pasting to the cursor
location is done by typing "Ctrl+v".  (On a Mac, these would be done
with "Apple+c" and "Apple+v", respectively.)

In all cases below, text is pasted at the location of the cursor
within the terminal (and not necessarily at the location of the
mouse.)

Linux Terminals (non-Windows)
-----------------------------

**Keyboard**
   :Copy: Highlight text with the mouse, and then type "Ctrl+Shift+c"
          (by default, "Ctrl+c" cancels an operation running in the
          terminal)
   :Paste: Type "Ctrl+Shift+v"

**Mouse (no scroll wheel/middle button)**
   :Copy:  Highlight text with the mouse (that's really it!).
   :Paste: Press the middle button/scroll wheel (also fast!).

**Mouse (no scroll wheel/middle button)**
   :Copy: Right-click, and select "Copy" in the small menu that
          appears
   :Paste: Right-click, and select "Paste" in the small menu that
           appears


OS X Terminals ("Terminal" Application)
----------------------------

**Keyboard**
   :Copy: Highlight text with the mouse, and then type "Apple+c"
   :Paste: Type "Apple+v"

**Mouse (no scroll wheel/middle button)**
   :Copy:  Highlight text with the mouse (that's really it!)
   :Paste: Press the middle button/scroll wheel (also fast!)

   *NB: this mouse copy/paste only works within the terminal, not from
   other windows.  Must use keyboard to/from other windows.*

**Mouse (no scroll wheel/middle button)**
   :Copy: Right-click, and select "Copy" in the small menu that
          appears
   :Paste: Right-click, and select "Paste" in the small menu that
           appears


OS X Terminals ("Xquartz" Application)
----------------------------

We just note that there is some similar copy+paste behavior with the
"Terminal" terminals above, but that there are also differences;
behavior can also be adjusted in the Xquartz "Preferences", so it is
too difficult to generalize.  But users can explore...


Ubuntu on Windows  (WSL) Terminals
----------------------------------

To be able to copy+paste, one must activate this functionality by
right-clicking on the toolbar at the top of the panel, selecting
Properties, and then enabling "QuickEdit mode" (as described
:ref:`here <install_windows_VcXsrv>`).  After that:

**Mouse**
   :Copy:  Highlight text with the mouse (that's really it!).
   :Paste: Right-click
