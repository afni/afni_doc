*******************************************
**Install AFNI on Administered Systems**
*******************************************

These instructions are for those using administered systems (but not
*NIH-administered* systems, since there are specific instructions for
those in the main installation pages listed :ref:`here
<install_page>`).  Included are instructions divided into sections for:

* | **administrators**
  |  Those with root privilege, and who are possibly installing on one or
     more systems

* | **"regular" users**
  |  Those who are not expected to have root privilege for installations,
     but who still might personalize their own setup on a distributed
     system
