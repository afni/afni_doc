*******************************************
**Install AFNI on Administered Systems**
*******************************************

These instructions are for those using administered systems.  Included
are instructions for both:

* | **administrators**
  |  Those with root privilege, and who are possibly installing on one or
     more systems

* | **"regular" users**
  |  Those who are not expected to have root privilege for installations,
     but who still might personalize their own setup on a distributed
     system

The instruction pages are therefore given in pairs.  Some instructions
will refer to the general, personal computer instructions :ref:`here
<install_page>`.
